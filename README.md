## Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

I'm SlyCooperReloadCoded, a 27-year-old game reverse-engineer and preservationist who's always taking on new challenges and trying to make a difference in society, one byte at a time!

**My accomplishments:**

- Creating (but certainly not running or largely contributing to) the [SSX modding community](https://discord.gg/Qkn3NPKZGu
), something I didn't know I did until the most prominent modder said he joined because of my modding showcase video
- Creating a [speedrunning scene](https://discord.gg/aHA8DTyuNZ) for the obscure and underappreciated PlayStation 2 game known as Jonny Moseley Mad Trix
- Finding [new cheat codes](https://youtu.be/9EXoN8oh_4Y?t=1151) in an original Xbox game known as Toxic Grind
- Being one of two people to reverse-engineer another obscure title known as Rolling to make it fully completable, as some optional content was locked behind a [secret area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogu1ha7FNBY) no one knew existed
- Keeping the Watch Dogs 2 modding scene alive during long periods of no activity
- Creating a [modding scene](https://discord.gg/vCwqfSzrr9) for the Star Wars: Starfighter game franchise
- Rediscovered and [properly documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSXAPz7SmIs) an easter egg in Star Wars: Starfighter previously only documented on ancient forums that no longer exist

**My current projects:**

- [SSX Sound Pack](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/b89a1e4ae346c75ffba0e92b608b9f01), a resource containing every music track, voice line, and sound effect from every game in the SSX franchise, available in lossless FLAC, started due to the only resource behing low-quality game recordings
- *[Home's Foundations](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/6fcf2b07e9fce62aeedd0bd8b2bd1df9)*, an ever-expanding source of unbiased truth relating to any and all controversey and danger in the PlayStation Home revival scene, often censored and/or suppressed due to its accuracy
- [SSX Franchise Unused Content Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bt_NIiDekg), a massive video project showcasing all unused content across the entire SSX franchise, currently in limbo due to lack of motivation... perhaps there's a better format for this?
- Breaking and Entering (formerly known as Map Mastery), a game mod series for the first three Sly Cooper games, aiming to allow re-entry of all interiors and nullify dangers such as security lasers, damage planes, water, spotlights, etc.
- [Ultimate SSX Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Ultimate_SSX), [Ultimate Star Wars: Starfighter Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Ultimate_Star_Wars_Starfighter), and the [Jonny Moseley Mad Trix Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Jonny_Moseley_Mad_Trix)

**My wishes:**

- Jonny Moseley Mad Trix IGN beta build and/or full retail source code
- A debug-enabled Sly 2 build with the Monaco level in it, even if that's the only level
- SSX 3 full non-demo pre-alpha build, the one that was cut down to create the pre-alpha demo
- Star Wars: Starfighter E3 build (a.k.a. Star Wars Episode I: Starfighter) leak
- Toxic Grind early trailer build, the one with Cave Dwellings
- Enough money for a new gaming PC with ALL the bells and whistles so I'm not always 2 technology generations behind
- A girlfriend (if you're still a virgin when you turn 30, [you become a wizar](https://youtu.be/qRWgfbCm5ho?t=95)[d](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_TrsnpFCUzGJGydIjPn_OibwDK84nrl8fmOHO_yGhHg/edit?usp=sharing), and that doesn't interest me)
- Actual bottled Shirley Temple product sold on store shelves, one that can't be discontinued
- Destination Home releasing what they've hoarded and making a fully-transparent public apology admitting all wrongdoings

**My advice:**

- Facts don't care about your feelings.
- Actions speak louder than words.
- Treat others the way you want to be treated.
- Ignorance only equals compliance or agreement if sufficient evidence proves you're in the wrong.
- Listen to the smallest voice before paying attention to the loudest voice.
- The best liar you know is NOT the best liar you know.
- Admitting you're wrong shows strength, except if you're not wrong, which shows weakness.
- It IS possible to be born with a brain incapable of learning something specific.
- If you have everything you want in life, then there's no point in living.
- "Closed-source preservation" is a term coined by hoarders to justify their mindset.
- Game developers should ALWAYS drink their consistence-tea to avoid silly development choices that hinder others' progress.
- Anyone who says "It'll get better" to someone with depression should not be talking to people with depression.
- Some people don't have a purpose in life and were meant to fail, and there's nothing wrong with that.
