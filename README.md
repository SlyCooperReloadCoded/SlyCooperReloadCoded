## Welcome to my little corner of the internet

I'm SlyCooperReloadCoded, a game reverse-engineer and preservationist who's always taking on new challenges and trying to make a differene in society, one byte at a time!  27 years old and she/her, before anyone asks.

**My accomplishments:**

- Creating the SSX modding community, something I didn't know I did until the most prominent modder said he joined because of my modding showcase video
- Creating a speedrunning scene for the obscure and underappreciated PlayStation 2 game known as Jonny Moseley Mad Trix
- Finding new cheat codes in an original Xbox game known as Toxic Grind
- Being one of two people to reverse-engineer another obscure title known as Rolling to make it fully completable, as some optional content was locked behind a secret area no one knew existed
- Keeping the Watch Dogs 2 modding scene alive during long periods of no activity
- Creating a modding scene for the Star Wars: Starfighter game franchise
- Rediscovered and properly documented an easter egg in Star Wars: Starfighter previously only documented on ancient forums that no longer exist

**My current projects:**

- SSX Sound Pack, a resource containing every music track, voice line, and sound effect from every game in the SSX franchise, available in lossless FLAC, started due to the only resource behing low-quality game recordings
- *Home's Foundations*, an ever-expanding source of unbiased truth relating to any and all controversey and danger in the PlayStation Home revival scene
- SSX Franchise Unused Content Video, a massive video project showcasing all unused content across the entire SSX franchise, currently in limbo due to lack of motivation... perhaps there's a better format for this?
- Breaking and Entering (formerly known as Map Mastery), a game mod series for the first three Sly Cooper games, aiming to allow re-entry of all interiors and nullify dangers such as security lasers, damage planes, water, spotlights, etc.
- Ultimate SSX Iceberg, Ultimate Star Wars: Starfighter Iceberg, and the Jonny Moseley Mad Trix Iceberg

**My wishes:**

- Jonny Moseley Mad Trix IGN beta build leaks
- Sly 2 Monaco build leaks
- SSX 3 full non-demo pre-alpha build leak
- Star Wars: Starfighter E3 build leak
- Toxic Grind early trailer build leak
- Enough moeny for a new gaming PC with ALL the bells and whistles so I'm not always 2 technology generations behind
- A girlfriend (if you're still a virgin when you turn 30, you become a wizard, and that doesn't interest me)
- Actual bottled Shirley Temple product sold on store shelves, the recent soda that failed to replicate the flavor doesn't count
- Destination Home releasing what they've hoarded

**My advice:**

- "Closed-source preservation" is a term created by hoarders to justify their mindset.
- Game developers should ALWAYS drink their consistence-tea to avoid silly development choices that don't help anyone.
- No, ignorance does NOT equal compliance.
- Yes, it is possible to be born with a brain incapable of learning something, "nah you're just making excuses" not applying to you.
- If you get everything you want in life, then what's the point of living?
- Treat others the way you want to be treated.
- Just because the most influential person says something doesn't mean it's true.
- Anyone who says "It'll get better" to depression has no clue what they're talking about.
- Some people don't have a purpose in life and were meant to fail, and there's nothing wrong with that.
- Admitting that you were wrong is an attractive quality, because it shows strength.
