## Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

I'm SlyCooperReloadCoded, a 27-year-old game reverse-engineer and preservationist who's always taking on new challenges and trying to make a difference in society, one byte at a time!

**My accomplishments:**

- Creating the [SSX modding community](https://discord.gg/Qkn3NPKZGu
), something I didn't know I did until the most prominent modder said he joined because of my modding showcase video
- Creating a [speedrunning scene](https://discord.gg/aHA8DTyuNZ) for the obscure and underappreciated PlayStation 2 game known as Jonny Moseley Mad Trix
- Finding [new cheat codes](https://youtu.be/9EXoN8oh_4Y?t=1151) in an original Xbox game known as Toxic Grind
- Being one of two people to reverse-engineer another obscure title known as Rolling to make it fully completable, as some optional content was locked behind a [secret area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogu1ha7FNBY) no one knew existed
- Creating a [modding scene](https://discord.gg/vCwqfSzrr9) for the Star Wars: Starfighter game franchise
- Rediscovered and [properly documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSXAPz7SmIs) an easter egg in Star Wars: Starfighter previously only documented on ancient forums that no longer exist
- Created the [SSX Sound Pack](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/b89a1e4ae346c75ffba0e92b608b9f01), a resource containing every music track, voice line, and sound effect from every game in the SSX franchise, available in lossless FLAC, started due to the only resource behing low-quality game recordings
- *[Home's Foundations](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/6fcf2b07e9fce62aeedd0bd8b2bd1df9)*, a source of unbiased truth relating to any and all past controversey and danger in the PlayStation Home revival scene, often censored and/or suppressed due to its accuracy

**My current projects:**

- Breaking and Entering (formerly known as Map Mastery), a game mod series for the first three Sly Cooper games, aiming to allow re-entry of all interiors and remove dangers such as security lasers, damage planes, water, spotlights, etc.
- [Ultimate SSX Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Ultimate_SSX), [Ultimate Star Wars: Starfighter Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Ultimate_Star_Wars_Starfighter), and the [Jonny Moseley Mad Trix Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Jonny_Moseley_Mad_Trix)

**My dream game prototype leaks:**

- Jonny Moseley Mad Trix IGN beta build and/or full retail source code
- A debug-enabled Sly 2 build with the Monaco level in it, even if that's the only level
- SSX 3 full non-demo pre-alpha build, the one that was cut down to create the pre-alpha demo
- Star Wars: Starfighter E3 build (a.k.a. Star Wars Episode I: Starfighter)
- Toxic Grind early trailer build, the one with Cave Dwellings and possibly the test levels

**My wishes:**

- The Jonny Moseley Mad Trix speedrunning scene exploding with activity, people constantly finding new strats and useful glitches, dedicated reverse-engineering team
- Enough money for a new gaming PC with ALL the bells and whistles so I'm not always 3 technology generations behind
- A romantic partner

**My advice:**

- No, you DON'T know what they're going through.
- Interpreting a person's words before their intent has disasterous results.
- Ignorance only equals compliance or agreement if you're being accused of something and you're in the wrong.
- Judge a person by what they CAN do, not what they CAN'T do.
- The victim has a hard time defending themselves, while the guilty does not.
- Admitting you're wrong shows strength, but only if you are wrong.
- People too depressed to process positive encouragement interpret it as pity, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do anything to help.
- Success is a goal, not a guarantee.
