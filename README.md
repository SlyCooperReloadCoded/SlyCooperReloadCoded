## Welcome to my little corner of the internet

I'm SlyCooperReloadCoded, a game reverse-engineer and preservationist who's always taking on new challenges and trying to make a differene in society, one byte at a time!

**My accomplishments:**

- Creating the SSX modding community, something I didn't know I did until the most prominent modder said he joined because of my modding showcase video
- Creating a speedrunning scene for the obscure and underappreciated PlayStation 2 game known as Jonny Moseley Mad Trix
- Finding new cheat codes in an original Xbox game known as Toxic Grind
- Being one of two people to reverse-engineer another obscure title known as Rolling to make it fully completable, as some optional content was locked behind a secret area no one knew existed
- Creating a modding scene for the Star Wars Starfighter game franchise
- Rediscovered and properly documented an easter egg in Star Wars: Starfighter previously only documented on ancient forums that no longer exist
- SSX Sound Pack, a resource containing every music track, voice line, and sound effect from every game in the SSX franchise, available in lossless FLAC, started due to the only resource behing low-quality game recordings

**My current projects:**

- *Home's Foundations*, an ever-expanding source of unbiased truth relating to any and all controversey and danger in the PlayStation Home revival scene
- SSX Franchise Unused Content Video, a massive video project showcasing all unused content across the entire SSX franchise, currently in limbo due to lack of motivation... perhaps there's a better format for this?
- Breaking and Entering (formerly known as Map Mastery), a game mod series for the first three Sly Cooper games, aiming to allow re-entry of all interiors and nullify dangers such as security lasers, damage planes, water, spotlights, etc.
