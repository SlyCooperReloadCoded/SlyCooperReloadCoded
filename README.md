## Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

I'm SlyCooperReloadCoded, a 27-year-old game reverse-engineer and preservationist who's always taking on new challenges and trying to make a difference in society, one byte at a time!

**My accomplishments:**

- Creating (but certainly not running or largely contributing to) the [SSX modding community](https://discord.gg/Qkn3NPKZGu
), something I didn't know I did until the most prominent modder said he joined because of my modding showcase video
- Creating a [speedrunning scene](https://discord.gg/aHA8DTyuNZ) for the obscure and underappreciated PlayStation 2 game known as Jonny Moseley Mad Trix
- Finding [new cheat codes](https://youtu.be/9EXoN8oh_4Y?t=1151) in an original Xbox game known as Toxic Grind
- Being one of two people to reverse-engineer another obscure title known as Rolling to make it fully completable, as some optional content was locked behind a [secret area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogu1ha7FNBY) no one knew existed
- Creating a [modding scene](https://discord.gg/vCwqfSzrr9) for the Star Wars: Starfighter game franchise
- Rediscovered and [properly documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSXAPz7SmIs) an easter egg in Star Wars: Starfighter previously only documented on ancient forums that no longer exist
- Created the [SSX Sound Pack](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/b89a1e4ae346c75ffba0e92b608b9f01), a resource containing every music track, voice line, and sound effect from every game in the SSX franchise, available in lossless FLAC, started due to the only resource behing low-quality game recordings

**My current projects:**

- *[Home's Foundations](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/6fcf2b07e9fce62aeedd0bd8b2bd1df9)*, an ever-expanding source of unbiased truth relating to any and all controversey and danger in the PlayStation Home revival scene, often censored and/or suppressed due to its accuracy
- Breaking and Entering (formerly known as Map Mastery), a game mod series for the first three Sly Cooper games, aiming to allow re-entry of all interiors and remove dangers such as security lasers, damage planes, water, spotlights, etc.
- [Ultimate SSX Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Ultimate_SSX), [Ultimate Star Wars: Starfighter Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Ultimate_Star_Wars_Starfighter), and the [Jonny Moseley Mad Trix Iceberg](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Jonny_Moseley_Mad_Trix)

**My wishes:**

- Jonny Moseley Mad Trix IGN beta build and/or full retail source code
- A debug-enabled Sly 2 build with the Monaco level in it, even if that's the only level
- SSX 3 full non-demo pre-alpha build, the one that was cut down to create the pre-alpha demo
- Star Wars: Starfighter E3 build (a.k.a. Star Wars Episode I: Starfighter)
- Toxic Grind early trailer build, the one with Cave Dwellings and possibly the test levels
- Enough money for a new gaming PC with ALL the bells and whistles so I'm not always 3 technology generations behind
- A romantic partner (if you're still a virgin when you turn 30, [you become a wizard](https://youtu.be/qRWgfbCm5ho?t=95), and that doesn't interest me)
- Actual bottled cherry Shirley Temple product sold on store shelves, one that can't be discontinued
- Destination Home staff releasing what they've hoarded, making a fully-transparent public apology admitting all wrongdoings, stepping down, and letting their community elect new staff

**My advice:**

- Functional humans don't use artificial intelligence as a replacement for literacy skills or other basic brain capabilities.

Using ChatGPT to correct spelling mistakes in a school paper you've written is okay, but asking ChatGPT to generate an essay for a school assignment is not okay.

- Facts don't care about your feelings.

Flat-Earthers feel insulted when people call the Earth "round", often attacking others because of this, but this does not disprove that the Earth is round.

- Interpreting a person's words before interpreting their intent has disasterous results.

I've had my words interprteted before my intentions many, many times.  Trust me, it gets nasty.  Don't do it.

- Treat others the way you want to be treated.

Don't tell someone they're stupid if you don't want to be told that you're stupid.

- Facts and truths by definition cannot be offensive, since offense is rooted in opinion.

History is factual and did happen, even during pre-human times where the entire concept of offense did not exist, such as the Prehistoric Era.  The dinosaurs could not try and alter documentation of events, so you also should not.

- Ignorance only equals compliance or agreement if you're actively involved.

Not wanting politics showing up on your social media feeds does not mean you actively despise your country's government and/or encourage its wrongdoing, however if you're a government official, then you likely do.

- Judge a person by what they CAN do, not what they CAN'T or DON'T do.

As Albert Einstein once said, "Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid."

- Listen to the smallest voice before paying attention to the loudest voice.

If a widely-known influencer creates blackmail and destroys the life of an innocent victim with no social media presence, any attempt the victim could make to prove themselves innocent will be overshadowed by the words of the content creator. If the smallest voice was listened to first, then the issue would've been solved very quickly.

- Admitting you're wrong shows strength, except if you're not wrong, which shows weakness.

Always do your own research into whether or not you have any reason to apologize for something that people are telling you to apologize for.  You could be correct or incorrect, but it's always good to check first.

- Closed source projects are real and common, and there's nothing wrong with them, however "closed-source preservation" is a term coined by hoarders to justify their morally-incorrect mindset.

BetaArchive stores development builds of video games, however it only grants download access if you provide a dump of software so incredibly specific that no one beyond a meager few will ever get access, and it has a group of people dedicated to attacking anyone who complains about it being hard to access, therefore the entire site is immoral, only exists to hoard data, and has rightfully earned the title of "hoarding community". 

- Game developers should ALWAYS drink their consistence-tea to avoid silly development choices that hinder future development.

If another developer on your team has already programmed a function you're also trying to program, use their programming instead of writing your own in a completely different way, especially if there's no gain or consequence for doing so.  This will help other developers on your project be able to tell what's going on, as well as making the lives of consumers easier post-release.

- Anyone who says "It'll get better" to someone with depression should not be talking to people with depression.

This is an easy way to spot an untrained therapist or counselor, especially in education systems.

- Some people don't have a purpose in life and were meant to fail, and there's nothing wrong with that.

If success was available to every living human being, then failure would be meaningless. It's not meaningless, proving that this point is correct.
