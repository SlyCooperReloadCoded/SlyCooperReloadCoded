## Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

I'm SlyCooperReloadCoded, a 28-year-old game reverse-engineer and preservationist who's always taking on new challenges and overwhelming myself in the process!

**The word:**

Putting in effort is far more valuable than accomplishing something, even if you never accomplish what you set out to do.

**My accomplishments:**

- Creating the [SSX modding community](https://discord.gg/Qkn3NPKZGu), something I didn't know I did until the most prominent modder said he joined because of my modding showcase video
- Creating a [speedrunning scene](https://discord.gg/aHA8DTyuNZ) for the obscure and underappreciated PlayStation 2 game known as Jonny Moseley Mad Trix
- Finding [new cheat codes](https://youtu.be/9EXoN8oh_4Y?t=1153) in an original Xbox game known as Toxic Grind
- Being one of two people to reverse-engineer an obscure title known as Rolling to make it fully completable, as some content was locked behind a [secret area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogu1ha7FNBY) no one outside of an early 2000s French THPS IRC channel knew about
- Creating a [modding scene](https://discord.gg/vCwqfSzrr9) for the Star Wars: Starfighter game franchise
- Rediscovered and [properly documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSXAPz7SmIs) an easter egg in Star Wars: Starfighter previously only documented in [Star Wars Gamer magazine issue 4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ynrcDlH9-l6rsty9u5WzH5zMzMCasv0Q/view?usp=sharing)
- Created the [SSX Sound Pack](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/b89a1e4ae346c75ffba0e92b608b9f01), a resource containing every music track, voice line, and sound effect from every game in the SSX franchise, available in lossless FLAC, started due to the only resource behing low-quality game recordings
- *[Home's Foundations](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/6fcf2b07e9fce62aeedd0bd8b2bd1df9)*, a source of unbiased truth relating to any and all past controversey and danger in the PlayStation Home revival scene, often censored and/or suppressed due to its accuracy

**My current projects:**

- My second job, which will likely take up most of my time

**My on-hiatus projects:**

- [Breaking and Entering](https://slymods.info/wiki/Mod:Breaking_and_Entering) (formerly known as Map Mastery), a game mod series for the first three Sly Cooper games, aiming to allow re-entry of all interiors and remove dangers such as security lasers, damage planes, water, spotlights, etc. Very messy, not in CLPS2C patch format, and will greatly benefit from new advancements in game script creation that are just barely not possible at the moment, but all the tech is there.
- [LOD Fixer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLdY6UOnTsM), a mod for Sly 2 which increases the draw distance of larger map meshes to match the infinite draw distance of the rest of the map, fixing gaping holes that appear often too close to the player. This is a very difficult mod to make, it can't be automated, the NTSC-U release doesn't have a freecam mod yet, and there's no easy way to visualize changes. It's also not in CLPS2C format.
- [Normal Platformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvgtuIilh0I), a mod for Sly 2 which removes all Thief Move interacts except where it's completely impossible to progress, and creates new paths where possible. Likely not possible to make memory-shift compatible, isn't in CLPS2C format, and is low priority compared to other projects.

**My dream game software leaks:**

- [Jonny Moseley Mad Trix IGN beta build](https://gist.github.com/SlyCooperReloadCoded/c4a69e62c14dddeeb8c59e27b43c89ca) and/or full retail source code
- A debug-enabled Sly 2 build with the Monaco level in it, even if that's the only level
- SSX 3 full non-demo pre-alpha build, the one that was cut down to create the pre-alpha demo
- Star Wars: Starfighter E3 build (a.k.a. Star Wars Episode I: Starfighter)
- Toxic Grind early trailer build, the one with Cave Dwellings and possibly the test levels
